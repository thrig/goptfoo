goptfoo(3) - utility functions for command-line option parsing

Build and install along the lines of:

  unset CFLAGS
  export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15
  export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69
  autoreconf -i
  ./configure [--prefix=...] && make && make install

Once installed, include the library and call the appropriate flagto*
functions. If the user input cannot be parsed, or lies outside the given
limits, an error message will be sent to standard error, and the process
will exit with a code from sysexits(3).

Consult goptfoo(3) for a list of available functions and example code;
see also the demo/ directory of this distribution.


BUGS

Bugs and feature requests should be directed to:

https://github.com/thrig/goptfoo

though the intent is not to greatly complicate this code, which means no
gettext or the like for fancy internationalized error messages, nor
error handling beyond simply calling err() to bail the process when
things go awry.


PORTABILITY

Portability has not been much tested, with my usage being mostly
confined to OpenBSD (6.7), less so Mac OS X (10.10), and much less so
Linux (RedHat EL 6).


CLEANUP

To clean up the auto* leavings, perhaps:

  find . | git check-ignore --stdin | xargs rm

Assuming the .gitignore patterns are correct. Or, clone from a clean git
repository, and delete the clone when done building.

HISTORY

Motivated by the need for option processing in C, and the unportability
of the otherwise excellent OpenBSD strtonum(3) function (leaving aside
how to handle floats), and the much boilerplate required to at least
provide a modest barrier to invalid or otherwise malicious input. These
functions at one point littered various scripts, then got moved to
arbitrary *.{c,h} files that were manually included, and finally to this
library. The Churchill quote on doing everything first the wrong way is
much in mind.
